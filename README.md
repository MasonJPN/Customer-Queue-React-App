Queue Management App (In Progress)

This is a Queue Management Application built with React.
It’s designed to help manage customers efficiently by keeping track of a queue and their requested services.



This was my one of my first attempts to follow along and build something in React.

Features (Implemented so far)
-Add a customer with name and service type
-Display the current queue
-Styled with basic CSS for readability

Features Planned / Work in Progress:
-Update customer status (e.g., completed, in progress)
-Remove customers from the queue
-Persistent storage (localStorage or backend)
-More polished UI/UX and animations
-Technologies Used
-React (Functional Components & Hooks)
-CSS for styling
-React Icons for UI elements
